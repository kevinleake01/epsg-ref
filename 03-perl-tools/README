Here are a selection of programs written in Perl.

You will need to have Perl installed on your computer, and in Perl there is a program called cpan. From cpan,
you then install another program called App::cpanminus which makes installing Perl modules easy:

$ sudo cpan App::cpanminus

For more information about installing cpan modules see:

https://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html
